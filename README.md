# APCS-A Distance Program

## Overview
This program calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of points in a 2D plane.  
Students will practice using `Scanner`, custom delimiters, loops, and formatted output in Java.

---

## Instructions
1. Ask the user **how many inputs** (pairs of points) they want to enter.  
2. For each input, prompt them to enter two points in the format:
   ```
   (x1,y1)(x2,y2)
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   (2,3)(7,3)
   ```
3. Configure `Scanner` with a **custom delimiter** so it ignores `(`, `)`, `,`, and spaces:
4. Extract `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` as doubles.  
5. Compute the distance using the correct formula
6. Print the results with formatted output.  
7. Repeat until all inputs have been processed.

## Example Inputs
```
How many inputs? 3
Enter input 1 (like (x1,y1)(x2,y2)): (2,3)(7,3)
Enter input 2 (like (x1,y1)(x2,y2)): (4,5)(8,8)
Enter input 3 (like (x1,y1)(x2,y2)): (-1,-2)(0,7)
```
